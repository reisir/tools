- text selectors and animators
- puppet pin
- 3D layers
- custom workspaces
- rewrite Composition a bit, add this: "the main use of compositions in AE is organization and re-use and to help with compositing as some effects and techniques are better applied on a precomp rather than on the clips directly"

## General

  - qBitTorrent
- Image Editor
  - Note about photopea
