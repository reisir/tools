Bézier masking in Vegas Pro, the anchor creation tool and more.

===

Masking in Vegas Pro is done using the Anchor Creation Tool, which creates the bézier curves you're used to in other programs. Masking can be done in the Pan/Crop menu or using the Bézier Masking FX. The latter is more useful for motion tracking.
