Bézier masking in Vegas Pro, the anchor creation tool and more.

===

Masking in Vegas Pro is done using the Anchor Creation Tool, which creates the bézier curves you're used to in other programs. Masking can be done in the Pan/Crop menu or using the Bézier Masking FX. The latter is more useful for motion tracking and will be covered in the [motion tracking guide](/vegas-pro/motion-tracking).

## Creating and animation masks using the Pan/Crop menu

### How to create a mask
Select the event that you wish to mask on its track and go to the [Pan/Crop menu](/vegas-pro/pan-and-crop#the-pan-crop-menu). At the bottom of the Pan/Crop menu, make sure to enable the mask layer, then select it.

Select the Anchor Creation Tool [i=vppen/] on the left of the menu and proceed to mask. To see your mask on the preview, make sure to press [i=syncCursor/]. 

The mask can be as precise as you want depending on how many points you make.  You can remove one of your anchoir points by right clicking on it or by using the Anchor Deletion Tool.
