Guides for new editors or anyone who wants to learn the basics of Vegas Pro.

===

## Why Vegas Pro

Vegas Pro is perfect for beginners as it's probably the most intuitive and easiest to learn "real video editing program" out there, for people who have no experience. If you're used to the key binds that Adobe software like Photoshop has, try Premiere. In my opinion Premiere is a bit unwieldy for people who have no experience with neither Adobe nor creative software in general.

Full disclosure, I started with Vegas Pro and I hate Premiere for non-objective reasons. So yes I am biased. But having used Vegas and Premiere, well forced to use Premiere, I long for Vegas' easy to use and most of all RESPONSIVE timeline. It doesn't matter that Premiere technically has more features, when using it is a slog.

Most of these guides are written by [Bastiera](/bastiera) and edited by [me](/reisir). If you have any questions on your editing journey, you can reach a community of editors in the [bentovid discord server](https://bentovid.com), the best AMV server out there. If you're interested, you may also join the [amv.tools](/discord) discord server for news about the site. I won't provide any editing help on the amv.tools server though.

I have rambled more than enough. Get reading some of these guides!
