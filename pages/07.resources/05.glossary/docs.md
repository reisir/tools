#### Aspect Ratio

A number or set of numbers that expresses the ratio of the width and height of a video. Usually written in the form of WIDTH:HEIGHT eg. 16:9 (read 16 by 9). The less common form to write aspect ratios is the decimal result of the ratio eg. 1920/1080 = 16/9 = 1.777...

## B

#### Beta

#### Color Grading

[Color Grading on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_grading).

Grading is the creative part of working with color, making a "look" for your scenes, conveying emotion or symbolism. Most of the time all sources have some level of grading already applied which can be hard to deal with. The process of dealing with a scenes color grading and color differences in general is called [color correction](#color-correction)

#### Cut

#### Keyframe

Keyframe refers to a value that's assigned a time in an animation. Usually indicated with a small diamond shape. When an animation has two or more keyframes, each frames value is calculated depending on how close to each keyframe it is. Some programs let you change the weight or influence of each keyframe, effectively changing the speed of the animation from one keyframe to another. This animation speed manipulation is called [easing](#easing).

#### Keying

Process of isolating certain pixel values, like color or brightness, and turning that into transparency. An example of keying is chroma keying or "greenscreening" which is keying by a color, turning the selected color into transparent pixels.

#### Non-Linear Editing

## R

#### Render

Rendering is the process of turning the source footage and your edits (aka your timeline) into a new video. Sometimes used interchangeably with [export](#export)

#### Resolution

The dimensions of a video or a project in pixels. Usually displayed in the form WIDTHxHEIGHT, eg. 1920x1080. Due to the prevalence of the 16:9 [aspect ratio](#aspect-ratio), shorthands like [1080p](#full-hd) usually refer to 1920x1080.
