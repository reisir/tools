A course to help intermediate and advanced editors get started with After Effects.

## What is After Effects?

After Effects is a compositing program. In a normal "non-linear editing" program, you're arranging scenes to form a video. In After Effects, you're combining multiple media sources to form a scene. The most basic example of compositing is using a green screen when recording, to key it out and replace it with another background. People also use AE for [motion design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNGtnkLi5Js) which is basically animated graphic design, animation in general, [special effects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyixMpuGEL8) and pretty much anything to do with video.

My point is, AE is made for compositing, not arragement. It's sound design, not melody. It's seasoning, not groceries. You can [animate](./animation) anything, track camera movements, post process your footage into a pixel mush, but you ~~cannot~~ should not use After Effects to scrub through an entire season of anime to find the scenes you're going to use. You should already have that part done. It's easiest to use Premiere Pro for that, since it exports to After Effects with a single click, but you can use anything that exports video. Like [Vegas Pro](/vegas-pro) for example.

So what is After Effects good for if you ~~can't~~ shouldn't use it for scene selection? Scene selection is everything! Well, you most likely do not need to use After Effects. But if you want to [composite your own scenes](https://youtu.be/F-i2p4zIxUg), make [MMVs](https://youtu.be/HVSDOZra70o),  [push the boundaries of video compression algorithms](https://youtu.be/Upy-1IeHkLc) or do any kind of "technical" editing you want After Effects (or Resolve or Blender or Final Cut or Vegas Effects I guess).

Anyway, here are some guides to get you started!
