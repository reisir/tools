# Traditional

cutting images into parts, animating with anchor points at joints

- cutting characters in Photoshop / photopea / paint.net 
- filling in at the joints to allow rotation
- using anchor points and parenting to make animatable limbs -> fully animatable character

# Puppet Pin

No cutting required, restricted motion.

- setting up pins
- types of pins (no idea how they work lol)
- how to animate with puppet pin and the restrictions of it

# Combine

Have to test how feasible this is, could probably split at limbs instead of joints

- try cutting limbs and using puppet pin to animate the limbs
- should result in smoother animation
